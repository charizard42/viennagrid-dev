 \item Using tags instead of topologic dimension to identify elements
 \item Added support for dynamic elements: polygon and PLCs
 \item Added support for neighbour iteration
 \item Added support for multiple segmentations
 \item New algorithms: intersection, seed point segmenting
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Version 1.0.1}
This is a maintenance release, mostly fixing minor compilation problems on some compilers and operating systems. Other notable changes
\begin{itemize}
  \item Added \lstinline|distance()| function for computing the distance between points, cell, etc.
  \item Voronoi quantities can now also be accessed in a more fine-grained manner: Volume and contributions for each cell attached to a vertex or edge.
  \item Added quantity transfer: Interpolates quantities on a $m$-cells can be transferred to $n$-cells. Both $m<n$ and $n>m$ are supported.
\end{itemize}

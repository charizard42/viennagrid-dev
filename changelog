*** Version 1.1.x ***

-- Version 1.1.0 --
The ViennaGrid internals have been completely redesigned for higher flexibility.
Smaller adjustments to the user API were necessary:
 - New storage layer, re-wrote most of the internals
 - Using tags instead of topologic dimension to identify elements
 - Added support for dynamic elements: polygon and PLCs
 - Added support for neighbour iteration
 - Added support for multiple segmentations
 - New algorithms: intersection, seed point segmenting

*** Version 1.0.x ***

-- Version 1.0.1 --
This is a maintenance release, mostly fixing minor compilation problems on some compilers and opererating systems. Other notable changes
 - Added \lstinline|distance()| function for computing the distance between points, cell, etc.
 - Voronoi quantities can now also be accessed in a more fine-grained manner: Volume and contributions for each cell attached to a vertex or edge.
 - Added quantity transfer: Interpolates quantities on a $m$-cells can be transferred to $n$-cells. Both $m<n$ and $n>m$ are supported.


-- Version 1.0.0 --
First release
